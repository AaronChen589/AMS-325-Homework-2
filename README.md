# AMS-325-Homework-2

## Homework 2 Task 1
NumberOfOccurences is a function that takes a number argument and returns 2 to the power of
that number.
estimationOfPi is also a function that takes a number argument (N-total) and returns the Pi
estimation.
MainQuestion1 utilizes both functions to plot two graphs that showcases the relationship 
between Pi estimation and N-total.

## Homework 2 Task 2
Tol is a function that takes the number "n" as an argument and returns the value of 2 to the power of negative n.
estimationOfPiUsingTol is a function that takes Tol as an argument and uses a while loop to randomly generates a point that will determine whether it's in a circle or not. Pi_estimate is updated upon the completion of each loop until the while loop is satisfied and returns that Pi_estimate.
MainQuestion2 utilizes both functions to plot the time it takes to compute a Pi_estimation for a certain Tol against Tol.

## Homework 2 Task 3
MonteCarloSimulation.m  will create a simulation similar to the Monte Carlo Method by plotting 1000 randomly generated points. It will record and save each points when they are graphed and saves it into an avi file.
